        <h3>Reflection 1</h3>
        <p>
          I had some struggles with this lab, maybe because I'm on a MacBook and things work a little different.
          At first I wasn't sure how to save my file in VS Code and I ended up uploading the wrong version.
          I also had trouble figuring out the correct link for my aboutme.html, but once I fixed that I was able to validate and upload it right.
          With more practice I’ll get more confident using VS Code and GitHub but overall, now that I’ve turned my assignment in and I look back at all the steps it wasn’t bad — I actually enjoyed it.

      <section id="lab2">
        <h3>Reflection 2</h3>
        <p>
          Since Lab 2, I learned how to connect a CSS file and add styles to my page.
          It feels good to see the design change with colors and fonts.
          The <span class="highlight">class selector</span> helped me see
          how to style using just a few words instead of the whole paragraph.
          I also used Color Hunt to choose my color palette, which made the page more aesthetic.
        </p>

      <section id="lab3">
        <h3>Reflection 3</h3>
        <p>
          For Lab 3, I learned how to connect my HTML to a CSS file and add basic styles like colors and fonts.
          I also tried out an ID selector and a class selector, which showed me how to style just one part of a paragraph.
          Since it was my first time using colors, I was nervous to overdo it, so I kept things simple.
          Because I work full time, I usually complete my labs in small portions after work and then finish the final touches on Sundays before submitting.
          Usually, it takes me a couple of days to get everything done since I spread it out instead of doing it all at once because I get overwhelmed easily but so far it’s fun.

      <section id="lab5">
        <h3>Reflection 5</h3>
        <p>
          In Lab 5, I learned how to make my page responsive so it looks good on both phones and desktops.
          I used Flexbox and media queries for the first time to adjust the layout depending on the screen size.
          It felt tricky at first but started making sense when I tested it in the browser.
          I also added a navigation menu that jumps to each reflection, which made my page easier to explore.
          Overall, this lab showed me how structure and styling work together to make a real website.
