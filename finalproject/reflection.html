    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>

    <p>
      Completing this final project helped me bring together everything I learned
      throughout the CSIT-121 course. One of the biggest challenges for me was
      staying organized with my files and making sure links, images, and styles
      worked correctly across all pages. As the project came together, I felt more
      confident in my ability to structure a website using proper HTML elements
      and external CSS.

      Testing the website on multiple browsers and devices was an important part
      of the process. I noticed small differences in spacing and layout when
      viewing the site on different browsers and on a mobile screen. Using a
      media query helped ensure the navigation adjusted properly for smaller
      screens, which improved usability and accessibility.

      Overall, this course taught me the fundamentals of modern web development,
      including semantic HTML, responsive design, accessibility, and validation.
      These skills helped me understand how real websites are built and gave me a
      strong foundation to build more complex projects in the future.
