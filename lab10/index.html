    <h2>What is WebVTT?</h2>

    <p>WebVTT stands for Web Video Text Tracks. It is a text format used to add captions and subtitles to online videos. The captions appear on the screen at specific times, helping viewers read the words while the video plays.</p>

    <p>The WebVTT file is separate from the video file, but it works together with the video player. Each caption has a start and end time. When the video reaches that moment, the browser shows the matching text on the screen.</p>

    <p>WebVTT is supported by HTML5 video, which makes it widely used on many websites. Platforms that show videos often rely on this format to add captions, descriptions, or other text that helps people follow along.</p>
