    <h2>How Is WebVTT Used?</h2>

    <p>WebVTT is used by websites to show captions on videos. When a video plays, the browser reads the WebVTT file to see which line of text should appear at each moment. The text pops up on the screen as the video reaches the times that match the captions in the file.</p>

    <p>A common example is YouTube. When you turn on captions, YouTube often uses a format similar to WebVTT to display the words on screen. Other websites with video players, like education sites or news pages, also use it for subtitles, descriptions, and labels.</p>

    <p>Web developers can also create their own WebVTT file by writing short lines of text along with timestamps. They then connect the file to an HTML5 video tag. When users click the “CC” button, the browser automatically loads the caption file and shows the text at the right time.</p>
