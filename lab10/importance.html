    <h2>Why is WebVTT Important?</h2>

    <p>WebVTT is important because it makes online videos easier to understand for more people. Captions help viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing follow along with the audio. Even people without hearing problems use captions when a video is noisy or hard to hear.</p>

    <p>It also supports different languages. A video can have subtitles in English, Spanish, or any language the creator chooses. This helps people from different backgrounds watch the same video without confusion.</p>

    <p>Many websites and platforms use WebVTT because it improves accessibility, which is a required standard for many online services. Having clear captions makes videos more user-friendly and helps websites meet accessibility rules.</p>
